### Environment Highlights:

- Same as Data Management Platform Reference Architecture
- Servers shown per role
- Network connections and ports not shown here to keep the diagram simple enough to follow
- Optional components are shown as yellow dashed boxes
- One Nexus is shared across all environments.  This is the starting point.  The customer needs to justify why they need more than 1 Nexus across the whole deployment.
- JobServer deployed on Edge Nodes for Big Data Yarn Client processing.
- JobServers are installed seperate from TAC Servers in Advanced Configuration.
