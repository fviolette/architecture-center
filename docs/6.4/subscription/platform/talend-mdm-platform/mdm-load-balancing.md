### HTTP Load Balancer

- The MDM server distribution does not provide any HTTP load balancer. The load balancer must be installed separately.

- MDM server is compatible with any HTTP load balancer (Hardware or Software) as long as it provides session affinity (i.e. the capability to redirect all the requests concerning a session to the same node)

- All BPM requests directed to a single node
