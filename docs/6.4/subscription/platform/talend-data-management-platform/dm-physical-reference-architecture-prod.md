*Download a [Visio file][DM-Architecture-6.4-Prod] that contains this architecture diagram.*

### Environment Highlights:

- Servers shown per role per environment
- We will replicate the servers on the right for each environment
- No Nexus shown here because it is on our SDLC Server.
- Central Log Server is not shown here.
- Data Prep and Data Stewardship are not shown here.
- Failover device is generally Apache Httpd, VIP, or a Load Balancer.  However, not all Load Balancer are tested by Talend.  Hence, limitations will exist.

### Advanced Configurations:
- **[Setting up High Availability][ha]**

- **[Using Virtual Job Servers][vjs]**
